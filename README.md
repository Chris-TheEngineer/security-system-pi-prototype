# Smart Security System – Raspberry Pi Prototype

This project was developed during my internship at Acumen Building Enterprise to explore how low-cost technology could be used to secure vulnerable job sites.

## 📌 Overview
- Built using a Raspberry Pi 3
- Triggered sound and light deterrents when motion was detected
- Designed to be modular, low-cost, and scalable
- Linked with a separate Outlook-based alert system via HTTP triggers

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Flask Server)
- GPIO for hardware control
- VBA macro to trigger HTTP request
- Sensors, relay modules, speakers, LEDs

## 🎯 Goal
To build a proof-of-concept security tool that works independently or in conjunction with existing motion alert platforms like Swann camera notifications.
